# Classic Lasagne

A recipe by Claude Sonnet IV

## Ingredients

- 12 lasagne sheets (dried or fresh)
- 500g ground beef (or mix of beef and pork)
- 1 large onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 400g can crushed tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 cup red wine (optional)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### For the Béchamel Sauce:
- 4 tbsp butter
- 4 tbsp plain flour
- 500ml whole milk
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- Salt and white pepper to taste

### For Assembly:
- 200g mozzarella cheese, grated
- 100g Parmesan cheese, grated
- 250g ricotta cheese

## Instructions

- Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).

- Cook the lasagne sheets according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside on a clean tea towel.

- Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened.

- Add minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

- Add the ground meat, breaking it up with a spoon. Cook for 8-10 minutes until browned and cooked through.

- Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, and red wine if using. Season with salt and pepper.

- Simmer the meat sauce for 15-20 minutes until it thickens. Remove from heat and set aside.

- For the béchamel sauce: melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 2 minutes to form a roux.

- Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring no lumps form. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens (about 5-8 minutes). Season with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper.

- To assemble: spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 23x33cm baking dish.

- Layer 3-4 lasagne sheets over the sauce, then spread 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce over the pasta.

- Dot with 1/3 of the ricotta, then pour over 1/3 of the béchamel sauce. Sprinkle with some mozzarella and Parmesan.

- Repeat the layering process twice more, finishing with a final layer of pasta sheets topped with the remaining béchamel and cheeses.

- Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until golden and bubbling.

- Let the lasagne rest for 10-15 minutes before serving to allow it to set and make cutting easier.

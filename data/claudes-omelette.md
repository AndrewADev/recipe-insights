# Classic French Omelette

A classic French omelette recipe that's simple yet elegant:

## Ingredients:

* 3 fresh eggs
* 2-3 tablespoons butter
* Salt and white pepper to taste
* Optional: fresh herbs like chives, parsley, or tarragon

## Method:

1. Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk vigorously until completely smooth - no streaks of white should remain
2. Season lightly with salt and a pinch of white pepper
3. Heat a non-stick or well-seasoned pan over medium-low heat
4. Add butter and let it foam, then swirl to coat the pan
5. Pour in the eggs and immediately start stirring gently with a fork or spatula, keeping the eggs moving
6. As curds form, tilt the pan and let uncooked egg flow underneath
7. When the eggs are almost set but still slightly creamy on top (about 2-3 minutes), stop stirring
8. If using herbs, sprinkle them on one half
9. Fold the omelette in half using your spatula and slide onto a plate
10. The key is gentle heat and constant movement until the very end. The omelette should be pale yellow, creamy, and never browned. The whole process takes just a few minutes, so have your plate ready!

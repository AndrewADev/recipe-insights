# RecipeBoard

A tool to help hobbyist chefs discover and better understand the implicit dependencies in recipes theyâ€™d like to cook or bake.

**Notice**: Includes generated sample recipes that have not been tested/verified in the real world and may contain mistakes or improper instructions. Please use common sense and follow all applicable food and appliance safety recommendations when cooking!

## Development

Set up pre-commit with:
```shell
 uv run pre-commit
```

### Updating `requirements.txt` (after dependency updates)

The project uses `uv` for package management internally. To run on HuggingFace, however, a `requirements.txt` is required for now. You can update it with the following command:
```shell
 uv pip freeze | grep -v "file://" > requirements.txt
```

#### Additional updates

Note that updates to `gradio` and `python` need to also be reflected in the HuggingFace Space configuration meta at the top of this file.
